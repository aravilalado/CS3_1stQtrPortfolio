# First Quarter Reflections

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.  
Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.  

1. **JavaScript Operations**  
   This took me a while to remember without doing out-of-class studying. But with the amount of practices we got on this, I could say I'm rather decent at it now. Repeated exposure to exercises helped me gain confidence in using arithmetic and logical operations in different problem scenarios.  

2. **Variable Declaration**  
   This is one of the first things that we learned. It is also actively practiced during exercises in class as it is one of the fundamentals. Because of its constant use in almost every activity, I have become comfortable using `var`, `let`, and `const` appropriately.  

3. **I/O Statements**  
   This was straightforward for me to understand. The simplicity of the lesson, along with the right assistance in doing practices, really made a difference. I can now easily handle input from the user and produce the necessary output to the console.  

4. **Switch Case**  
   This is one of the lessons I understood almost immediately after discussion, to my surprise. It was a fun lesson to have and learn in class. The exercise regarding this topic was tricky at first, but it felt fulfilling afterward. Now I can confidently apply switch-case statements as an alternative to multiple if-else statements.  

5. **Conditional Statements (if, else if, else)**  
   Learning conditionals was not too difficult for me because they are very logical and direct. Practicing them through coding tasks helped me recognize the importance of flow control. I find them useful in almost every program we write, which strengthened my familiarity with them.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  

1. **Processing Function Output**  
   I understand the concept of returning values from functions, but I sometimes struggle to apply it in more complex problems. I need further practice to get used to passing data back and forth between functions smoothly.  

2. **Loop Control Structures (while, do..while, for..in)**  
   Although I know the syntax, I get confused about when to use each type of loop. I especially need practice with `do..while` since it feels less intuitive than the others.  

3. **Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)**  
   I sometimes forget when to apply `break` and `continue` correctly. Nested loops are also confusing, so more exercises would help me get used to them.  

4. **Declaring Functions**  
   I know the basic structure of function declarations, but I get lost when combining them with parameters and return statements. I also get lost whenever it's something more than a basic function

5. **Number Objects**  
   This was a bit hard to grasp at first. I managed to get the hang of it in some way, but I am still not confident about the methods and properties of Number objects. More examples and practice would help me master them.

## 3. Describe your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed in the second item.  

To improve on these topics, my plan is to regularly practice coding exercises that specifically use them. I will review class notes and re-read examples until I become more comfortable with the concepts. Watching tutorials and looking up documentation online will also help me understand their real-world use cases. Most importantly, I will try to apply these topics in small personal coding projects, so I can see how they work in actual programs. I will also ask questions in class whenever I get confused so I do not fall behind :3

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.  

**Effective Activities:**  
1. **Hands-on coding exercises** – These helped me apply what we learned immediately after the discussion. They made me realize my mistakes quickly and gave me a chance to correct them while the lesson was still fresh.  
2. **Code discussions on the whiteboard-projector** – it allowed me to see and understand better what was happening with my code. It also helped me see better what was the right thing to do and see my possible mistakes.

**Not Effective Activities:**  
1. **Long lectures without coding practice** – Sometimes, too much theory without application made me lose focus. I understand concepts better when I can practice them right away.  
2. **Rushed activities** – There were times when exercises felt too short, so I couldn’t fully digest the topic. Having a bit more time to reflect and apply would have made them more helpful.
