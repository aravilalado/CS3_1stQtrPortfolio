# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections
### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
1. **JavaScript Operation**s - This took me a while to remember without doing out of class studying. But with the amount of practices we got on this, I could say I'm rather decent at it now. 
2. **Variable Declaration** - This is one of the first things that we learned. It is also actively practiced during exercises in class as it is one of the fundementals.
3. **I/O Statements** - This was straightforward for me to understand. The simplicity of the lesson along with the right assistance in doing practices, it really helped make  dfference.
4. **Switch Case** - This is one of the lessons I got immediately to my suprise. It was a fun lesson to have and learn whilst in class. The excersise regarding this topic was tricky but it felt fufulling afterwards.
5.
