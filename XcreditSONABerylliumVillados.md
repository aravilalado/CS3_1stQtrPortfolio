* "Php 20 Rice" since this was a promise that was made before that failed to be fufilled. He also stated " “Napatunayan natin na kaya na natin ang bente pesos sa bawat kilo ng bigas, nang hindi malulugi ang mga magsasaka!” which to many, is misleading because of the many kinds of injustices towards farmers -- whose livelyhoods are deteriorating because they are forced to sell rice for Php 8-12 -- because of this program.
